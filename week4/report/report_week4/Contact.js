        It is located in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula,
        bordering Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do and Ulju-gun, Ulsan Metropolitan
        City to the north, and Jinhae-gu, Changwon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do and
        Gimhae-si to the west. There are many mountainous areas, so there are
        many areas where urban areas are formed not only on the plains but also
        on the foothills.
